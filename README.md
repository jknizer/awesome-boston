# awesome-boston
A curated list of resources that might keep you in love with the greater Boston area of Massachusetts (and places nearby). Tourist-specific resources abound, and the best are linked here. Rather, the goal is one place to track the evolving hidden gems of the region for someone who lives here. 

Land Acknowledgment
The greater Boston metro region where we work and play exists on land stolen from the first and ongoing indigineous custodians, specifically the Massachusee (Massachusett) & Wôpanâak (Wampanoag) First Nations Peoples; with particular recognition for the Patuxet (Pawtucket), Neponset, Naumkeag, Pocasset & Pokanoket tribes, who have traveled, lived, worked, and cared for their unceded lands in and around Boston for tens of thousands of years. I write this in hoping you'll join me in acknowledging this community, their elders both past and present, as well as future generations. This acknowledgement demonstrates a commitment to beginning the process of working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism.
